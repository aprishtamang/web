    <img src="C:\Users\NITRO5\Desktop\nature.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" />
    <p style="flex-direction: row; ">Nature is the physical cosmos or world in its widest meaning. The term "nature" may be used to describe both universal life and the phenomena of the physical world. A significant, if not the sole, component of science is the study of nature. Despite the fact that people are a part of nature, human activity is frequently thought of as a distinct category from other natural occurrences.</p>
   
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Beauty of Nature</h1>

    <ul>
        <li title="tooltip option">INTRODUCTION</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Nature has given us so much that we cannot even imagine. Life on this earth is possible only because of nature.
        There are many other planets in the universe but without this nature life is not possible there. Thus nature is
        the basis of our life. Nature is not the same everywhere on earth. According to the place, nature changes its
        appearance and according to that place provides us with resources, as well as provides comfort to our mind, our
        eyes.

        Nature gives us so much, so it is our duty to respect it knowing its importance and not to destroy it for our
        selfishness. So that the children of man can also enjoy its beauty and take advantage of it, otherwise one day
        will be when people will be able to see and feel the beauty of this nature on the computer itself.</p>

        <h3> Beach</h3>
        <p>Beaches are also threatened by sea level rise. Sea levels have been gradually rising
            for many years, drowning some beaches completely.

            New Moore Island, for example, was a small, uninhabited island in the Bay of Bengal. Both India and
            Bangladesh claimed the island, which was little more than a strip of sandy beach. In March 2010, rising sea
            levels drowned the island completely. New Moore Island is now a sandbar. </p>

            <h3>Butterfly</h3>
            <p>One of the most common questions we get at the Nature Museum is, “What do butterflies eat?” In order to better understand what they eat, we have to understand how they eat!

                Butterflies have a long tongue, called a proboscis, which they can curl and uncurl to drink through like a straw. Because of their straw-like mouthparts, butterflies are mainly restricted to a liquid diet. 
                
                Butterflies use their proboscis to drink sweet nectar from flowers. Nectar sometimes resides deep within a flower and the proboscis allows the butterfly to reach this sugary treat. We fill the Judy Istock Butterfly Haven with an abundance of flowering plants that produce ample nectar for the butterflies, including: coral vine, firespike, jungle cucumber, Ixora, and lantana.
                
                We also provide sponge pads soaked with simulated nectar for the butterflies. The simulated nectar is made by mixing honey and water. </p>
